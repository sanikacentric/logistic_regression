Logistic Regression: Full Intuition and Explanation

What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a machine learning method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two outcomes. Examples include:

Will a student pass or fail?

Is an email spam or not?

Will a customer buy or not?

Inputs and Outputs

Inputs: Multiple features such as study hours, income, age, etc.

Output: A probability between 0 and 1, interpreted as the likelihood of one of the two classes.

The Prediction Process

Linear Combination:

Logistic regression starts by multiplying each input feature by a weight, which indicates the feature's importance.

It adds these weighted values together to get a raw score.

The Problem with Linear Regression:

Linear regression can produce any real number as output, even negatives, which makes no sense for probabilities.

Sigmoid Function to the Rescue:

The raw score is passed through the sigmoid function, which squashes any real number into the range [0, 1].

This output can be interpreted as a probability.

Making the Decision:

If the probability is 50% or more, predict "Yes."

If it's less than 50%, predict "No."

The threshold can be adjusted based on business needs.

The Learning Process

Starting with Guesses:

The model starts with random weights.

Measuring Mistakes:

The model compares its predictions to the actual results and measures how wrong it was.

Cost Function (Log-loss):

Logistic regression uses a special function that penalizes confident but wrong predictions more heavily.

This function ensures the learning process focuses on correcting its worst errors.

Adjusting Weights (Gradient Descent):

The model adjusts its weights slightly to reduce the error.

This process repeats many times until the model makes the smallest possible errors.

Why Log-loss and Not Mean Squared Error?

Mean squared error (used in linear regression) can create multiple local minima (non-convex function), making learning unstable.

Log-loss creates a smooth, convex curve, ensuring gradient descent can reliably find the best weights.

Start with Inputs.

Apply weighted formula.

Pass result through sigmoid to get a probability.

Apply threshold to make a decision.

Compare prediction to actual result.

Adjust weights accordingly.

Repeat until model improves.

Where is Logistic Regression Used?

Summary

Logistic Regression is simple, powerful, and interpretable. It takes your input data, applies weights, squashes the result into a probability using the sigmoid function, and makes decisions based on a threshold. It continuously learns by adjusting its weights through gradient descent, using a carefully designed cost function that guarantees stable and accurate learning.
